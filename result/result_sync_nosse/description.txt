Used grid size with rank 6...12 with size 64K...256M respectively.
On last grid less tile size was used due to limited memory.
Graph shows time consumed to perform 2^30 (~1 billion) stencil calculations.
Stencil calculation requires 12 double-precision floating-point operations.
So, in total, 12 billion operations are performed.
Single core of Intel Core i3-3110M  has 20 Gflops peak performance.
So, efficiency per time T seconds equals 0.6/T.
